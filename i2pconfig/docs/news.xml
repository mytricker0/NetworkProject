<h3>Feb 8, 2025: Local site access fails in 2.8.0</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
In 2.8.0, browsing to a local site (either by hostname or b32) will fail.
The workaround is using localhost and the server port, usually 7658, to bypass I2P.
For example, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7658/">http://127.0.0.1:7658/</a>.
We apologize for the issue and are working on a fix.

<h3>Oct 8, 2024: I2P 2.7.0 Release</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
This release, I2P 2.7.0, continues our work by fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding features.
</p><p>
Access to information from the console and applications has been improved.
Issues have been fixed in I2PSnark and SusiMail search.
The netDB search embedded into the router console now operates in a more intuitive and useful way.
Minor improvements have been made to diagnostic displays in advanced mode.
</p><p>
Bugs have also been fixed to improve compatibility within the network.
An issue with publishing leaseSets was solved which improves reliability major hidden services.
I2PSnark no longer changes the infohash when a user changes only the trackers on an existing torrent.

<h3>Jul 20, 2024: I2P 2.6.0 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
This release, I2P 2.6.0, continues our work by fixing bugs, adding features, and improving the network&apos;s reliability.
</p><p>
Newer routers will be favored when selecting floodfill routers.
I2PSnark received features which improve the performance of PeX(Peer Exchange), in addition to bug fixes.
Legacy transport protocols are being removed, simplifying the code in the UDP transports.
Locally-hosted destination will be reachable by local clients without requesting their LeaseSet, improving performance and testability.
Additional tweaks were made to peer selection strategies.
</p><p>
I2P no longer allows I2P-over-Tor, connections from Tor exit IP addresses are now blocked.
We discourage this because it degrades the performance of I2P and uses up the resources of Tor exits for no benefit.
If you are a helpful person running both a Tor Exit and I2P we encourage you to continue to do so, using different IP addresses for each.
Non-exit relays and Tor clients are unaffected by this and do not need to change anything.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
I2P 2.5.1 is released to address Denial-of-Service Attacks affecting the I2P network and services.
With this release we disable the IP-based parts of the Sybil attack detection tool which were targeted to amplify the effect and duration of the attack.
This should help the network return to normal operation.
Those of you who have disabled the Sybil attack detection tool may safely re-enable it.
Adjustments to other subsystems to improve RouterInfo validation and peer selection have also been made.

<h3>Apr 26, 2024: Stormy Weather</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
The I2P network is currently under a Denial-of-Service attack.
This attack affects I2P and i2pd but in different ways and is having a serious effect on network health.
Reachability of I2P sites is badly degraded.
</p><p>
If you are hosting a service inside I2P and it is hosted on a Floodfill router, you should consider multihoming the service on a Floodfill-disabled router to improve reachability.
Other mitigations are being discussed but a long-term, backward-compatible solution is still being worked on.

<h3>Apr 8, 2024: New Release I2P 2.5.0</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
This release, I2P 2.5.0, provides more user-facing improvements than the 2.4.0 release, which was focused on implementing the NetDB isolation strategy.
</p><p>
New features have been added to I2PSnark like the ability to search through torrents.
Bugs have been fixed to improve compatibility with other I2P torrent clients like BiglyBT and qBittorrent.
We would like to thank all of the developers who have worked with libtorrent and qBittorrent to enable and improve their I2P support.
New features have also been added to SusiMail including support for Markdown formatting in emails and the ability to drag-and-drop attachments into emails.
Tunnels created with the Hidden Services manager now support &quot;Keepalive&quot; which improves performance and compatibility with web technologies, enabling more sophisticated I2P sites.</p><p>
During this release we also made several tweaks to the NetDB to improve its resilience to spam and to improve the router&apos;s ability to reject suspicious messages.
This was part of an effort to &quot;audit&quot; the implementation of &quot;Sub-DB isolation&quot; defenses from the 2.4.0 release.
This investigation uncovered one minor isolation-piercing event which we repaired.
This issue was discovered and fixed internally by the I2P team.
</p><p>
During this release several improvements were made to the process of releasing our downstream distributions for Android and Windows.
This should result in improved delivery and availability for these downstream products.

<h3>Dec 18, 2023: I2P 2.4.0 Release with Congestion and NetDB Security improvements</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
This release, I2P 2.4.0, continues our effort to improve the security and stability of the I2P network.
It contains significant improvements to the Network Database, an essential structure within the I2P network used for disovering your peers.
</p><p>
The congestion handling changes will improve network stability by giving routers the ability to relieve congested peers by avoiding them.
This will help the network limit the effect of tunnel spam.
It will also help the network heal during and after DDOS attacks.
</p><p>
The NetDb changes also help secure individual routers and the applications that use them. 
Routers can now defend against attackers by separating the NetDB into multiple &quot;Sub-DB&apos;s&quot; which we use to prevent information leaks between applications and the router.
This also improves the information available to Java routers about their NetDB activity and simplifies our support for multihoming applications.
</p><p>
Also included are a number of bug-fixes and enhancements across the I2PSnark and SusiMail applications.
</p><p>
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release.

<h3>Jun 25, 2023: New Release I2P 2.3.0 - Security Fixes, Tweakable blocklists, DTG API</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
This release contains fixes for CVE-2023-36325.
CVE-2023-36325 is a context-confusion bug which occurred in the bloom filter.
An attacker crafts an I2NP message containing a unique messageID, and sends that messageID to a client.
The message, after passing through the bloom filter, is not allowed to be re-used in a second message.
The attacker then sends the same message directly to the router.
The router passes the message to the bloom filter, and is dropped.
This leaks the information that the messageID has been seen before, giving the attacker a strong reason to believe that the router is hosting the client.
This has been fixed by separting the bloom filter&apos;s functionality into different contexts based on whether a message came down a client tunnel, an exploratory tunnel, was sent to the router directly.
Under normal circumstances, this attack takes several days to perform successfully and may be confounded by several factors such as routers restarting during the attack phase and sensitivity to false-positives.
Users of Java I2P are recommended to update immediately to avoid the attack.
</p><p>
In the course of fixing this context confusion bug, we have revised some of our strategies to code defensively, against these types of leaks.
This includes tweaks to the netDb, the rate-limiting mechanisms, and the behavior of floodfill routers.
</p><p>
This release adds not_bob as a second default hosts provider, and adds <a href="http://notbob.i2p">notbob.i2p</a> and <a href="http://ramble.i2p">ramble.i2p</a> to the console homepage.
</p><p>
This release also contains a tweakable blocklist.
Blocklisting is semi-permanent, each blocked IP address is normally blocked until the router is restarted.
Users who observe explosive blocklist growth during sybil attacks may opt-in to shorter timeouts by configuring the blocklist to expire entries at an interval.
This feature is off-by-default and is only recommended for advanced users at this time.
</p><p>
This release also includes an API for plugins to modify with the Desktop GUI(DTG).
It is now possible to add menu items to the system tray, enabling more intuitive launching of plugins which use native application interfaces.

<h3>Apr 12, 2023: New Release 2.2.1, Packaging fixes for Docker, Ubuntu Lunar and Debian Sid</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
After the I2P 2.2.0 release, which was moved forward to accelerate mitigations for the DDOS attacks, we learned about a few developing issues which made it necessary to build and release new packages.
This release fixes an issue within Ubuntu Lunar and Debian Sid where the router console was inaccessible using an updated version of the jakarta package.
Docker packages were not reading arguments correctly, resulting in inaccessible configuration files.
This issue has also been resolved.
The docker container is now also compatible with Podman.

<h3>Mar 13, 2023: New Release 2.2.0, Mitigations to DDOS attacks and tweaks to the Streaming subsystem</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
We have elected to move forward the 2.2.0 release date, which will be occurring today, March 13, 2023.
This release includes a changes across the NetDB, Floodfill, and Peer-Selection components which improve the ability of the router to survive DDOS attacks.
The attacks are likely to continue, but the improvements to these systems will help to mitigate the risk of DDOS attacks by helping the router identify and de-prioritize routers that appear malicious.
</p><p>
This release also adds replay protection to the Streaming subsystem, which prevents an attacker who can capture an encrypted packet from being able to re-use it by sending it to unintended recipients.
This is a backward-compatible change, so older routers will still be able to use the streaming capabilities of newer routers.
This issue was discovered and fixed internally, by the I2P development team, and is not related to the DDOS attacks.
We have never encountered a replayed streaming packet in the wild and do not believe a streaming replay attack has ever taken place against the I2P network at this time.
</p><p>
As you may have noticed, these release notes and the release itself have been signed by idk, and not zzz.
zzz has chosen to step away from the project and his responsibilities are being taken on by other team members.
As such, the project is working on replacing the network statistics infrastructure and moving the development forum to i2pforum.i2p.
We thank zzz for providing these services for such a long time.

<h3>Feb 14, 2023: DDoS Update</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
We have confirmed that the attacker controls a large number of routers.
Our investigations and mitigations continue.
</p><p>
This is a good time to remind people that even after 20 years, the I2P network is relatively small.
We have no evidence that the attacker is attempting to deanonymize any particular user or hidden service.
However, if you have a high-risk threat model, you should carefully consider whether I2P currently provides the protection you require.
The best solution, in the long run, is to spread the word and grow the I2P network to increase security of our users.
</p><p>
We will provide additional information here in the news feed and on <a href="http://zzz.i2p">zzz.i2p</a> as necessary.
We ask for your patience as we work to improve I2P.

<h3>Feb 10, 2023: About the recent Denial of Service attacks</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
  The I2P network is currently being affected by a Denial of Service attack.
  The floodfill function of the network has been affected, resulting in responses being disrupted and tunnel build success rates dropping.
  Participants in the network have experienced difficulties connecting to I2P sites and using I2P services.
  Mitigation strategies are being investigated and implemented gradually.
</p><p>
  While the attack has degraded performance, the network remains intact and usable.
  Java I2P routers appear to be handling the issues better than i2pd routers for now.
  Various mitigations should begin to appear in dev builds of both Java and C++ routers in the next week.

<h3>Jan 9, 2023: 2.1.0 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
We have learned several things since our 2.0.0 release in November.
As routers have updated to that release, the network has gone from about 1% to over 60% support for our new SSU2 transport protocol.
First, we have confirmed that SSU2 is a solid, well designed, and secure protocol.
Second, however, we have found and fixed numerous minor or rarely-triggered bugs in the implementation of the protocol.
Cumulatively, the effects of these bugs have reduced the performance of the network.
</p><p>
Also, we are aware of increased tunnel count and reduced tunnel build success rate in the network,
possibly triggered by Bitcoin&apos;s new I2P transient address feature,
but made worse by our SSU2 bugs and other congestion control problems.
We are working with Bitcoin and other non-Bitcoin projects to reduce I2P network demands.
We have improved our algorithms to reduce network load during times of congestion.
We are also collaborating with i2pd to develop common congestion control strategies.
</p><p>
Therefore, we have accelerated this release by about six weeks, to get the fixes out to everybody.
i2pd released their version 2.45.0 last week and the early results are encouraging.
New protocols, and distributed networks, are difficult to develop.
Congestion can arrive with little warning and with little clue of the cause.
Thank you for your patience as we have diagnosed and hopefully fixed the problems.

We were aware of the problem soon after the release, but it took us almost two months to find the cause.
We eventually identified it as a bug in i2pd 2.40.0,
and the fix will be in their 2.41.0 release coming out about the same time as this release.
Along the way, we&apos;ve made several changes on the Java I2P side to improve the
robustness of network database lookups and stores, and avoid poorly-performing peers in tunnel peer selection.
This should help the network be more robust even in the presence of buggy or malicious routers.
Additionally, we&apos;re starting a joint program to test pre-release i2pd and Java I2P routers
together in an isolated test network, so we can find more problems before the releases, not after.
</p><p>
In other news, we continue to make great progress on the design of our new UDP transport &quot;SSU2&quot; (proposal 159)
and have started implementation.
SSU2 will bring substantial performance and security improvements.
It will also allow us to finally replace our last usage of the very slow ElGamal encryption,
completing a full cryptography upgrade that started about 9 years ago.
We expect to start joint testing with i2pd soon, and roll it out to the network later this year.
</p><p>
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.49 continues the work to make I2P faster and more secure.
We have several improvements and fixes for the SSU (UDP) transport that should result in faster speeds.
This release also starts the migration to new, faster ECIES-X25519 encryption for routers.
(Destinations have been using this encryption for a few releases now)
We&apos;ve been working on the specifications and protocols for new encryption for several years,
and we are getting close to the end of it! The migration will take several releases to complete.
</p><p>
For this release, to minimize disruption, only new installs and a very small percentage of existing installs
(randomly selected at restart) will be using the new encryption.
If your router does &quot;rekey&quot; to use the new encryption, it may have lower traffic or less reliability than usual for several days after you restart.
This is normal, because your router has generated a new identity.
Your performance should recover after a while.
</p><p>
We have &quot;rekeyed&quot; the network twice before, when changing the default signature type,
but this is the first time we&apos;ve changed the default encryption type.
Hopefully it will all go smoothly, but we&apos;re starting slowly to be sure.

A lack of CSRF protection meant that if a user was running I2P-Bote and then loaded a
malicious site in a browser with JavaScript enabled, the adversary could trigger actions
in I2P-Bote on behalf of the user, such as sending messages. This might also have enabled
extraction of private keys for I2P-Bote addresses, however no proof-of-exploit was tested

<a href="http://bote.i2p/install/">follow the instructions on the installation page</a> to
upgrade manually if you plan on using I2P or I2P-Bote in the intervening time. You should
also consider generating new I2P-Bote addresses if you regularly browse sites with
JavaScript enabled while running I2P-Bote.

<h3>Oct 17, 2016: 0.9.27 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.27 contains a number of bug fixes.
The updated GMP library for crypto acceleration, which was bundled in the 0.9.26 release for new installs and Debian builds only, is now included in the in-network update for 0.9.27.
There are improvements in IPv6 transports, SSU peer testing, and hidden mode.
</p><p>
We updated a number of plugins during <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2016/06/01/I2P-Summer-Dev">I2P Summer</a> and your router will automatically update them after restart.
</p><p>

<h3>Jun 7, 2016: 0.9.26 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.26 contains a major upgrade to our native crypto library,
a new addressbook subscription protocol with signatures,
and major improvements to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging.
</p><p>
For crypto, we have upgraded to GMP 6.0.0, and added support for newer processors,
which will speed up crypto operations considerably.
Also, we are now using constant-time GMP functions to prevent side-channel attacks.
For caution, the GMP changes are enabled for new installs and Debian/Ubuntu builds only;
we will include them for in-net updates in the 0.9.27 release.
</p><p>
For Debian/Ubuntu builds, we have added dependencies on several packages,
including Jetty 8 and geoip, and removed the equivalent bundled code.
</p><p>
There&apos;s a collection of bug fixes also, including a fix for a timer bug
that caused instability and performance degradations over time.
As usual, we recommend that all users update to this release.

<h3>Mar 22, 2016: 0.9.25 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.25 contains a major new version of SAM, v3.3, to support sophisticated multiprotocol applications.
It adds QR codes for sharing hidden service addresses with others,
and &quot;identicon&quot; images for visually distinguishing addresses.
</p><p>
We&apos;ve added a new &quot;router family&quot; configuration page in the console,
to make it easier to declare that your group of routers is run by a single person.
There are several changes to increase the capacity of the network and hopefully improve tunnel build success.

<h3>Jan 27, 2016: 0.9.24 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.24 contains a new version of SAM (v3.2) and numerous bug fixes and efficiency improvements.
Note that this release is the first to require Java 7.
Please update to Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible.
Your router will not automatically update if you are using Java 6.
</p><p>
To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it.
This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled.
The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.
For more details, see <a href="http://bote.i2p/news/0.4.3">this post</a>.

We had a great <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2016/01/23/32C3">32C3 Congress</a> and are making good progress on our 2016 project plans.
Echelon gave a talk on I2P&apos;s history and current status, and his slides are <a href="http://whnxvjwjhzsske5yevyokhskllvtisv5ueokw6yvh6t7zqrpra2q.b32.i2p/media/ccc/2015/I2P_Still_alive.pdf">here</a> (pdf).

<h3>Nov 19, 2015: 0.9.23 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
Hello I2P! This is the first release signed by me (str4d), after 49 releases
signed by zzz. This is an important test of our redundancy for all things,
including people.
</p><p><b>Housekeeping</b></p><p>
My signing key has been in router updates for over two years (since 0.9.9), so
if you are on a recent version of I2P this update should be just as easy as
every other update. However, if you are running an older version than 0.9.9, you
will first need to manually update to a recent version. Update files for recent
versions can be downloaded
<a href="http://whnxvjwjhzsske5yevyokhskllvtisv5ueokw6yvh6t7zqrpra2q.b32.i2p/releases/">here</a>,
and instructions on how to manually update are provided
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download#update">here</a>. Once you have manually
updated, your router will then find and download the 0.9.23 update as usual.
</p><p>
If you installed I2P via a package manager, you are not affected by the change,
and can update as usual.
</p><p><b>Update details</b></p><p>
The migration of RouterInfos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures is going well,
with at least half of the network already estimated to have rekeyed. This
release accelerates the rekeying process. To reduce network churn, your router
will have a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart. When it
does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it
reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
</p><p>
Note that this will be the last release to support Java 6. Please update to
Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible. We are already working to make I2P compatible
with the upcoming Java 9, and some of that work is in this release.
</p><p>
We have also made some minor improvements in I2PSnark, and added a new page in
the routerconsole for viewing older news items.
</p><p>
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.

<h3>Sep 12, 2015: 0.9.22 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.22 contains fixes for i2psnark getting stuck before completion, and begins the migration of router infos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures.
To reduce network churn, your router will have only a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart.
When it does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
If all goes well, we will accelerate the rekeying process in the next release.

<h3>Jul 31, 2015: 0.9.21 Released</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
0.9.21 contains several changes to add capacity to the network, increase the efficiency of the floodfills,
and use bandwidth more effectively.
We have migrated the shared clients tunnels to ECDSA signatures and added a DSA fallback
using the new &quot;multisession&quot; capability for those sites that don&apos;t support ECDSA.
